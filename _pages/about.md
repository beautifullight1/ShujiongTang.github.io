I completed my PhD in Machine Learning (Reinforcement Learning) at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2025, supervised by Prof. Zenglin Xu. Previously, I interned at the Peng Cheng Laboratory, where I worked on compute–network convergence scheduling. Before that, I was a visiting PhD student at Aalto University, focusing on offline reinforcement learning for sim-to-real transfer. I received a B.Eng. in Computer Science and Engineering from UESTC.

## Research interests

My research interests centre on reinforcement learning under distribution shift and limited prior knowledge, spanning demonstration-guided online RL, offline RL, and offline-to-online fine-tuning. I’m also interested in RL for scheduling and in RL security. Currently, I’m exploring how these ideas can be applied to LLM agents.
